Once upon a time, 

It all started one rainy evening as he was banging away at his computer He was doing an excellent job at it too!Talkin to his fellow gamers in a server of discord. It all started one rainy evening as he was banging away at his computer He was doing an excellent job at it too!Talkin to his fellow gamers in a server of discord. His friends on discord really helped with the stress.  However, after awhile he got bored.Very creeped out that this story knows their name. Playing some Overwatch, wrecking some noobs. I was carrying my team on my back, as always.I'm a diamond player and they were all silvers.Some people didn't think the universe be like it is, but it do. He decided to start his own frozen yogurt shop and call it Microsoft. No copyright law in the universe can stop me! - he said. "Why not?" the universe replied. It's high noon.But, little did he know...That bird do not know what it is .If you couldn't tell by now, our writers don't get paid very much.
Who was not really a young man, but still.
There was a kid in Software Engineering 1 who had no idea what he was doing. No one knows from where he came, but many say his past still haunts him. Or nowhere at all... 

There was a kid in Software Engineering 1 who had no idea what he was doing. He had never used Git before. No one knows from where he came, but many say his past still haunts him. Rumor has it that he lost a lawsuit to talking bees.The lake was a long way from here. She didn't know which way was up.There was a man named Sam. He loved universe so much. But the universe was indifferent. Also, I still play Runescape and I'm 21.There's nothing wrong with playing Runescape, unless you're still playing when you're 22.  Though they say the price of flax would never climb, I am certain they are wrong.

A new day started A day filled with sunshine and happiness. Harambe was still alive at the Cincinatti Zoo. Dragons were killing everyone I guess the cat's out of the bag now. The result of which would shock the world. Winter is comming, Nothing burns like the cold. This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes. Remember that all I am offering is the truth. He tried to take the blue pill, but there was a mix-up.  You would never guess what happened next. A bird crashed through his basement window!But that was okay with me.You would never guess what happened next. A bird crashed through his basement window! It was Errol, who had just recovered from hitting the Weasley's window. In bird culture, this is considered a dick move. He began to eat it with great ferocity. After he had his fill, he began to scream frantically. Chowing down on some pancakes and waffles.  No one would expect this. It was one of his favorite meals.I was finally there to sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air In other news, that's also why bears love honey. Since he didnt know what he was doing he failed the class. How amazing! Joe made the sugar cookies; Susan decorated them.And then I was like 'Don't eat that!'.There is no hope What am I going to do next? I decided to become the most wild breakdancer on the streets. My street name was Stadium Blvd. I will beat all the breakdancers. And the smell was just fantastic.I'll be wearing my baggy tracksuit and high-top sneakers.Beetoven with almost certain probability was of African Descent! Beetoven with almost certain probability was of African Descent!Decent doesn't matter though.

But enough with Beetoven, let's talk about Sofware EngineeringSoftware is hard to talk about so maybe lets talk about dogs.Actually, scratch that, let's not talk about it All people look very well. This is what it feels like to be schizophrenic.Infact all people are of African Descent. Once There Is A Beautiful Girl lalala She Is An Angel From The Heaven  lalalalActually, I don't think many of them have taken an english class before. They have no ability to read.

He really could have been from anywhere!

But enough with Beetoven, let's talk about Sofware EngineeringSoftware is hard to talk about so maybe lets talk about dogs.Dogs are very cute.Actually, scratch that, let's not talk about it All people look very well. This is what it feels like to be schizophrenic.I think having all these voices makes me a very fun person to talk with. Do crabs think fish are flying?Do lobsters think fish are flying too? Infact all people are of African Descent. Once There Is A Beautiful Girl lalala She Is An Angel From The Heaven  lalalalWow, this story got off track very fast.So about this girl Angel, she came to ruin this breakdancer named Stadium Blvd.Who was honestly a very friendly guy. First of all what kind of name is Stadium Blvd.It happens to be a very unique and delightful name! Flanders feeds me people food.  Silly customer, you cannot hurt a Twinkie. Twinkies are actually the sole subject of this entire story.Ohhhh yummy a TwinkieAmerica is run on the candy marketEven thought they are disgusting treats. Twinkies are 40 percent air.

The end.
