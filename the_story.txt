It all started one rainy evening as he was banging away at his computer He was doing an excellent job at it too!Talkin to his fellow gamers in a server of discord. It all started one rainy evening as he was banging away at his computer He was doing an excellent job at it too!Talkin to his fellow gamers in a server of discord.  47 percent of statistics are made up. This story was not meant for children, or adults - it should be burned in the fires of purification.His friends on discord really helped with the stress.  However, after awhile he got bored.Very creeped out that this story knows their name. After all I am the greatest player of all time!Playing some Overwatch, wrecking some noobs. I was carrying my team on my back, as always.I'm a diamond player and they were all silvers.Some people didn't think the universe be like it is, but it do. He decided to start his own frozen yogurt shop and call it Microsoft. Silvers have no chance against diamonds. No copyright law in the universe can stop me! - he said. "Why not?" the universe replied. It's high noon.This music is amazingBut, little did he know...That bird do not know what it is .If you couldn't tell by now, our writers don't get paid very much.

There was a kid in Software Engineering 1 who had no idea what he was doing. No one knows from where he came, but many say his past still haunts him. Or nowhere at all... 

There was a kid in Software Engineering 1 who had no idea what he was doing. He had never used Git before. No one knows from where he came, but many say his past still haunts him. Rumor has it that he lost a lawsuit to talking bees.The lake was a long way from here. The music is amazingShe didn't know which way was up.There was a man named Sam. He loved universe so much. But the universe was indifferent. Also, I still play Runescape and I'm 21.There's nothing wrong with playing Runescape, unless you're still playing when you're 22.  Though they say the price of flax would never climb, I am certain they are wrong.


But enough with Beetoven, let's talk about Sofware EngineeringSoftware is hard to talk about so maybe lets talk about dogs.Actually, scratch that, let's not talk about it All people look very well. This is what it feels like to be schizophrenic.Infact all people are of African Descent. Once There Is A Beautiful Girl lalala She Is An Angel From The Heaven  lalalalActually, I don't think many of them have taken an english class before.  I really hope this works.They have no ability to read.Fire Away!

I drink and I know things. It's not easy being drunk all the time.Honestly, I don't even know where this story is going, I just want the 50/50 on this assignment.I hope y'all dont hate me for my lack of story telling.  However I do my best to make it look easy. CS4320 lectures are motivation for me to stay drunk, that's one thing I know.I tried to help him but he didnt understand.It wasn't compatible with any angle.
None of this story actually matters though because this project was just a ploy to add all of our computers to a malicious botnet. Parallel lines have a lot in common.It's a shame they'll never meet. I dont really know where this story is going.It is a such long story. I met a girl with long curly hair in China.The yummy Twinkie is my favorite food. Once showed up in LA LA LAND.
